# Lethal Phones

As part of a new initiative, The Company has provided personal* phones to all employees.
Upon clocking in to your next shift, you will find that pressing '~' will produce your 'very own'* mobile phone. You can use the state-of-the-art Rotation Dialing system to call your fellow employees for easier communication on the job.

###### *The provided Mobile Phones are property of The Company. Employee owns no stake in the phone they are provided.

# Features

* Mobile Phones for all players!
* Take out your phone with '~' by default, all controls are customizable in the menu.
* Hold 'z' and click and move your mouse to dial the phone. Drag a number to the stopper to dial it just like a Real Mobile Rotary Phone.
* Phones do not take up an inventory slot, and do not require battery! In exchange, they are 'immersive' to use and may not be reliable under pressure.
* Phone calls will transmit all noises around the player you are talking to! Hear the explosion a split second before the call cuts!
* Switch your phone to vibrate if you don't want monsters to hear how popular you are! Or switch it to silent to ignore all your friends.
* Dynamic call quality! Have fun saying lines like "Can you repeat that?" and "What???" while deep in The Facility during a storm!

# Known Issues

* The 'phone effect' can linger on sounds longer than it should.
* Listening to calls while spectating is not 100% reliable at the moment.
* No config yet. It's on the way.
* Controllers currently have no way to dial the phone.
* Still hunting down various edge-cases through playtesting.
